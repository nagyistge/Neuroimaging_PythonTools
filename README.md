# Neuroimaging_PythonTools
These files contain some workflows based on (NiPyPe)[http://www.mit.edu/~satra/nipype-nightly/documentation.html], (DiPy)[http://nipy.org/dipy/], and my own functions for processing diffusion-weighted MRI data. 

The 'own_nipype' modules contains nodes with extensions for NiPyPe that are used in these workflows.
